MA35D1 Enhanced Pulse Width Modulator(EPWM)

The chip provides three EPWM generators including EPWM0 ~ EPWM2
Each EPWM supports 6 channels.

Required Properties of EPWM:

- compatible : Should be "nuvoton,ma35d1-epwm"
- reg : address and length of the register for the device.
- clocks: Enable EPWM clock.

Example:

	pwm0: pwm0@40580000 {
		compatible = "nuvoton,ma35d1-epwm";
		reg = <0x0 0x40580000 0x0 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&clk epwm0_gate>;
		status = "okay";
	};
