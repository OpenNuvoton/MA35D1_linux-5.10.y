Nuvoton MA35D1 GMAC driver

Required properties:
- compatible: "nuvoton,ma35d1-gmac"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain the EMAC interrupts
- interrupt-names: Should contain the interrupt names "macirq".
- nuvoton,ma35d1-sys: phandle to the syscon setting for gmac.
- clocks: First entry is the GMAC engine clock, and the second entry
	is <&clk epll_div8> for PTP clock.
- clock-names: Should be "stmmaceth" and "ptp_ref".
- resets: = Should contain the reset source of GMAC
- reset-names: Always "stmmaceth";
- clk_scr: Defines the MDIO clock rate, should set to 4.
- mac-id: Ether 0 or 1 depends on the GMAC instance
- phy-mode: see ethernet.txt [1].
- phy-handle: see ethernet.txt [1].

The MAC address will be determined using the properties defined in
ethernet.txt[1].

- PHY subnode: inherits from phy binding [2]
