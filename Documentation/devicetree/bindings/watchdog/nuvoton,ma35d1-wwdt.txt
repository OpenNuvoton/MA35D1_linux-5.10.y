Nuvoton Window Watchdog

The window watchdog supports a pre-timeout interrupt that fires 10ms before the
expiry.

Required properties:
- compatible      : must be "nuvoton,ma35d1-wwdt"
- reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts      : Contain the timer interrupt with flags for
                    falling edge.

Required clocking property, have to be one of:
- clk             : reference to the system clock


Example:

	wwdt1: wwdt@40400100 {
		compatible = "nuvoton,ma35d1-wwdt";
		reg = <0x0 0x40440100 0x0 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 44 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;	/* 76-32 */
		nuvoton,clk = <&clk>;
		clock-enable = "wdt1_gate";
		clock-names = "wwdt1_mux";
	};
