* NUC3500 Timer controller

The Timer controller includes 24-bit Timer0 ~ Timer11.
The Timer controller can perform functions, such as frequency measurement, delay timing, clock generation,
    and event counting by external input pins, and interval measurement by external capture pins.

    Required Properties of Timer controller:

    - compatible : Should be "nuvoton,ma35d1-timer"
    - reg : address and length of the register for the device.
    - interrupts:  Should contain Timer interrupt number
    - port-number:  Timer port number. Should be 0~11
    - nuvoton,clk: phandle to the syscon managing the "Clock Controller register".
    - clock-enable: Enable Timer clock.
    - clock-names: Control the mux to select Timer clock source.

    Example:

	timer2: timer_pwm2@40510000
	{
		compatible = "nuvoton,ma35d1-timer";
		reg = <0x0 0x40510000 0x0 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 49 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		port-number = <2>;
		nuvoton,clk = <&clk>;
		clock-enable = "tmr2_gate";
		clock-names = "tmr2_mux";
		status = "okay";
	};
